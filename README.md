## Final Programming Language Project

Here is my final project of the programming language course. In this course i've learned abou OOP using Java.

## About The Project

To finish this course, I decided to make an minefield game.
The source code can be found in the folder `src`. Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
